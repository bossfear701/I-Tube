# I Tube â€” Starter (Firebase Storage + Render backend)

This repo is a runnable starter pack that:
- Uploads videos directly from the browser to Firebase Storage.
- Notifies a lightweight Express backend (designed for Render) about uploaded videos.

Follow the README files in `frontend/` and `backend/` to configure and deploy.
